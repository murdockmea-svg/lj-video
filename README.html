lj-video Is A Video Player Designed By Liam Jackson
It Is Basically The (<video>) Tag With Download Protection And Supports Captions
But The Difference Is Instead Of Adding A Caption File You Add Your Text In A <script> tag 
also to add cuztiomze the javasprict then embed in html using the script tag
  Thanks,Liam
